# Discord-Whitelist-Bot
Developed by: Playboii Driizzyy (.driizzyb)

This is a simple Discord whitelist bot, it allows you to whitelist users and send them a direct join invite to a private discord server.
All you do is add the bot to both servers, the public server and private. Then use the /whitelist @user command to whitelist a user.
The bot will then send them a DM with the server invite link set in the .env file.

Setup is super easy, just head to the Discord Developer Portal and create a new bot with all the intents ENABLED!
Then simply add the bot to both servers and add the bot token in the .env file.
Then run the install.bat file if you haven't already, then run the start.bat file and enjoy!
